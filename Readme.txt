Please spare some time and download the following modules before running this code:
1. Selenium
2. Pytube
3. webdriver
4. requests

Point to note: You have to write the location where you want to save your file in the code (code will show you where you have to write it). And then run the code.

*Read ahead*(optional if you already have these modules)

[To download the following modules, you can open cmd, and write these commands one by one:

1. pip install selenium
2. pip install pytube
3. pip install webdriver-manager
4. pip install requests


(You can alternatively download all the modules in a single command: pip install selenium, pytube, webdriver-manager, requests)
]

(I'm assuming you have python installed in your computer at least. And pip too.)
